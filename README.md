# FirstGenAcademics
This project compares the study conditions of German students from non-academic and academic families. It uses data from the 2016 "Sozialerhebung" survey (RDC of the Federal Statistical Office and Statistical Offices of the Federal States, DOI: https://doi.org/10.21249/DZHW:ssypool:1.0.1, own calculations). Technically, the project is focused on data wrangling and cleaning to prepare it for visual analysis in Power BI.
